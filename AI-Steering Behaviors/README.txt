Student Name: Camilo Diaz

Project Name: Steering Behaviors

What I implemented: 100 boids using steering behaviors: Seek, Flocking, Follow the leader and Wander

Directions (if needed): 


PLEASE RENAME THE FILES INSIDE THE DEBUG FOLDER TO DLL




Keep press the mouse right button to rotate the camera
use the keys AWSD to move the cmaera around the scene




In the begining the boids need an initial velocity, that's the reason all of them are in vertical formation during the first 5 seconds of the simulation.
In flocking and seek mode, if the Move target check button is on, the target will move to a random position automatically.

Please DO NOT delete the debug and release folders. They contain the necesary libraries to run the application.

What I Learn: How to do basic AI using forces that modify the velocity and position of the game objects. Using this methods it is possible to simulate animals in 
vieogames.

Any difficulties I experienced while doing the project: For some strange reason in follow the leader mode, the boids shake randomly. I couldnt realize the reason for it.


Hours spent: 20 hours
